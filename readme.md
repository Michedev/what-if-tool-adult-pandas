# What-If tool example with pandas, scikit-learn and lightgbm

## Motivations
I've decided to create this repo since i've not found so many examples about what if tool around internet and unfortunately the WIT repo lacks of good documentation/examples

## Required libraries

- scikit-learn
- lightgbm
- pandas
- witwidget (or witwidget-gpu, depending on target architecture)

## Content

The notebook _example.ipynb_ contains an example with adult dataset like in [WIT website demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pair-code/what-if-tool/blob/master/WIT_Model_Comparison.ipynb) but using only most popular data science tools, like pandas to manage data, scikit-learn and lightgbm to compare different models

If you want to put your hands in WIT now, just execute all the cells into the notebook and in the last one you have a window with a running What-If-Tool
